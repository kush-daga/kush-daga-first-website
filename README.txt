Hi, CCS!
Thanks for your amazing workshop on webDev, it really helped me learn quite a few things and
helped me create this webpage.
All of this was created by myself without use of any kind of template from net and with some use of bootstrap.I spent neaely 10 hrs in the library to create this, hope you like it!
 It was tough understanding how to get the parallax effect of scrolling in my website, but after alot of tries i was able to comeup with a solution that was too fix the background image.
I implemented all that you wanted us to try..
1. Modals
2. Circular images
3.Fixed Nav bar( altho i was able to keeo it fixed while scrolling only the first page..would like to know how to implement it fully on webpage).

Also I am facing a bug in this webpage i created, the bug us that when i open the webpage first time the modal works well, however when i refresh the page and try to open it again, it doesnt work..i dont know why this is happening, please help.
( modal is the contact me button).

Thanks
